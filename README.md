Generate shell completions for Thor CLIs.

## Installation

```bash
gem install thor-completion
```

Or add the following line to your project's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "thor-completion"
```

## Usage

On your Thor CLI, add a command to generate the completion script:

```ruby
require "thor/completion"

class MyCLI < Thor
  desc "completion", "Generate shell completion script"
  option :shell,
         type: :string,
         required: true,
         enum: %w[bash zsh powershell fish]
  def completion
    puts Thor::Completion.generate(
      name: "mycli",
      description: "This is mycli",
      version: "1.2.3",
      cli: self.class,
      shell: options.shell
    )
  end
end
```

Then users can call `mycli completion --shell <SHELL>`. Loading the generated
script into their shell enables tab completion for your CLI.
